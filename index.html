Cornell University professors, who had built professional and personal ties while visiting Vietnam, were initially responsible with connecting refugees to resources in Ithaca. Given the historical interest in international affairs and the resources available at Cornell, Ithaca expanded from just an educational gateway community to a 'safe haven'. The refugee population also included refugees from all over Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and Loa.

In 1950, China sent in thousands of troops to enforce its claim on the region, leading to the exile of the 14th Dalai Lama. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, most of Tibet’s monasteries were destroyed and thousands of Tibetans are believed to have died under period of repressions and Marshall Law.'

The fall of the Saigon in 1975 lead to a mass exodus of people loyal to Southern Vietnamese forces. By 1977, around 20,000 people fled Vietnam as refugees, and it is estimated that nearly one-third of these people died from starvation, drowning, pirate activities, and being turned away before they could make it to safety. As many as 2 million civilians died at result of the Vietnam War.'

				bluemen: 9,
				redmen: 1,
				details: 'In late 1978, tragic wars between Indo-China broke out. Vietnam attacked Kampuchea (Cambodia) and later attacked Chinese forces in the North. The wars caused a rough estimate of 1.5 million people from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to flee their countries. The U.S. accepted approximately 823,000 as a result of these conflicts.'

The mixed raced children, referred to as "children of the dust",  were detested and subject to extensive mistreatment in Vietnam, as many people saw them as a connection to and reminder of US forces. Vietnam began to pursue aggressive policies to deport the children out of the country.'

				details: 'Members of many religions were persecuted throughout most years of the Soviet Union existence, with clergy members and other believers being killed, jailed, or sent to labor camps.  For example, after 1959, about 12,000 Russian Orthodox Churches were forcibly closed and their members targeted.  The Ukrainian Catholic Church was suppressed because of ties to Ukrainian nationalism.  And Soviet Jews were routinely persecuted during all periods of Soviet history. With the Lautenberg Amendment in 1989, the U.S. Congress opened refugee status to Soviet Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian Catholics, and Ukrainian Orthodox believers who proved "well-established histories of persecution” in the USSR, and who had family ties or sponsorship in the United States."'

The 1990 Immigration Act, although it did not officially call Tibetans refugees because of relations with China, opened 1,000 immigrant visas to “qualified displaced Tibetans,” providing them with permanent residence and work authorization (but no Federal funds or other usual refugee benefits for three years).  The Tibetans were resettled in 10 cluster sites in the U.S., including Ithaca, New York City, San Francisco, and Minneapolis.'

				details: 'As many as 250,000 Cubans entered the U.S. by boat between April and October of 1980 as part of the Mariel Boatlift. Refugees fled the country from the Port of Mariel due, in large part, to a sharp downturn in the Cuban economy, after Fidel Castro announced on April 20 that anyone wishing to leave the island could do so provided they had someone to pick them up. Cuban exiles in the US. hired boats, resulting in dozens of primarily Cuban and Haitian refugees arriving daily. Approximately 125,000 Cubans arrived in the U.S. on nearly 2,000 boats; 27 died. Upon their arrival, many Cubans were placed in refugee camps. Others were held in federal prisons pending deportation hearings. The majority of refugees were ordinary Cubans. Many had been allowed to leave Cuba for reasons which, in the United States, were either loyalty-neutral or protected: tens of thousands were Seventh-Day Adventists or Jehovahs Witnesses, for example. Some had been declared "anti-socialist" by their CDRs back in Cuba. In the end, only 2.2% (or 2,746) of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under U.S. law and denied citizenship on that basis.'

Over the next several years, Bosnian Serb forces, with the backing of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, targeted both Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) and Croatian civilians for atrocious crimes resulting in the deaths of some 100,000 people (80 percent Bosniak) by 1995. It was the worst act of genocide since the Holocaust. The U.S. resettled 169,000 refugees from Bosnia, along with a large number of Kosavar refugees, with the first planeload arriving at Fort Dix in 1999.'

Thousands of people were killed, arrested, tortured, and harassed by the military and police, and by the mid-1990s, hundreds of thousands of people were displaced within Burma and over a million refugees and migrants had escaped to Thailand and other nearby countries.  According to a study of 104 Burmese dissidents in Thailand, 89% had suffered interrogation, 78% had suffered imprisonment, 70% had suffered threats of deportation, and 38% had suffered torture.'

In 1990, the government launched a "systematic offensive" against the Eastern Burmese ethnic group, the Karen that led to the summary execution, severe torture, and rape, as well as forced labor, extortion, and displacement of Karen people. It is estimated that over 200,000 Karen people have been driven to flee their home.'

By 2015, continued conflict caused 4.4 million Iraqis to be internally displaced, and 2 million were forced to leave the country. Thousands of Iraqis and Afghans also worked with the U.S. military, often facing death threats from insurgents because of this work.  In 2007, the United States created the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program to bring up to 50 interpreters and translators to the U.S. per year from these countries.'
